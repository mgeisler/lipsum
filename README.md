This is small Rust library for generating traditional
mangled-Latin [lorem ipsum filler text][lorem ipsum] for your
application.


## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
lipsum = "0.3"
```

and this to your crate root:
```rust
extern crate lipsum;
```


## Documentation

Please see the **[API documentation][api-docs]**.


## Getting Started

Use the `lipsum` function to generate lorem ipsum text:
```rust
extern crate lipsum;

use lipsum::lipsum;

fn main() {
    // Print 25 random words of lorem ipsum text.
    println!("{}", lipsum(25));
}
```

The text will start with "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, …" and will
become random after 18 words. The text is generated using a Markov
chain which is trained on the full text of Cicero's work *De finibus
bonorum et malorum* ("On the ends of good and evil"). The classic
lorem ipsum text is derived from part of that book.


## Release History

### Version 0.3.0 — July 28th, 2017

Performance is improved

The `MarkovChain` struct has many new methods:

* `new_with_rng` makes it possible to specify the random number
  generator used by the Markov chain. Use this to get deterministic
  and thus reproducible output for tests. `MarkovChain` now owns the
  RNG it uses and as a consequence, it has an extra type parameter.
  This is a breaking change if you used struct directly in your code.

* `iter` and `into_from` return iterators over words in the Markov
  chain. The `generate` and `generate_from` methods are now
  straight-forward convenience wrappers for the iterators.

* `len` tells you the number of stats in the Markov chain and
  `is_empty` tells you if the Markov chain is empty, meaning that it
  hasn't been trained on anything yet.

### Version 0.2.0 — July 10th, 2017

Rust version 1.6.0 is now supported. This is checked with TravisCI.

### Version 0.1.0 — July 2nd, 2017

First public release.
